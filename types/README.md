# Types in PHP

In programming, a statement always results in a value. This value is of specific type. PHP statements can result in following types:

- `null`
- `bool`
- `string`
- `int`
- `float`
- `array`
- `object`
- `callable`
- `resource`

## Notes

- PHP is a dynamic language, which means the type of a variable is determined at runtime. However, PHP also allows you to specify the type of a variable during its declaration.

- Specifying the types in programs is good for debugging and reliability.

- We will learn more about types in upcoming topics when we dive into other PHP features: functions & classes.
