# Concept of OOP

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm centered around the concept of objects.
- Objects are instances of classes.
- Objects contain
  - data in the form of fields (aka properties/variables)
  - code in the form of procedures (aka methods/functions).

## Classes

- A blueprint for creating objects.
- It bundles related data and functions.

## Objects

- An instance of a class.
- An object is unique.

## Benefits of OOP

- Code Organization: OOP promotes better code organization by bundling related data and functions together into classes and objects.
- Encapsulation: Restricts direct access to object components, preventing accidental modification of data and ensuring that only authorized methods can modify an object's state.
- Inheritance: Allows code reusability by enabling new classes to inherit properties and methods from existing classes, reducing redundancy and improving maintainability.
- Abstraction: Simplifies complex functionality by introducing simple interfaces to carry out tasks, making it easier to work with and understand the underlying system.
- Polymorphism: Allows you to call different methods or functions using the same interface, enabling a single function to operate on different data types or classes. This makes the code more flexible and scalable.
