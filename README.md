# The PHP Language Guide

This repository can be used to quickly get the overview of the PHP language.

My primary goal is to be able to revise the PHP language without wasting too much time on the tutorials and the official documentation site.

## Note

- I used [php.net](https://php.net) as a reference for creating this document.
- I also used ChatGPT to simplify the descriptions.

## Some Basic Insights

- A computer program is a set of instruction to do a specific task. E.g.: process file, connect to database, process form, etc.
- We combine smaller pieces in programs to solve complex problems. So, always create smaller chunks of tasks and connect them later to perform much complex tasks.
- A programming language is designed with some specific problem solving capability in mind. Don't be picky! Just choose the right tool to fix the problem.
- In programming, it's impossible to remember everything.
- Always revise the knowledge. In doing so, you will always learn something new again.
- Instead of writing a new function from scratch, always try to find the inbuilt function (they are much faster than the custom functions).
- Go from basic to advanced.
- There is always some room for improvement.
- In programming, don't try to be a perfectionist.
- Make it work then optimize (clean/refactor) is the primary rule in Software Development.
